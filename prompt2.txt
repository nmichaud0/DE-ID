Task. You are a HIPAA de-identification classifier. For a target word in a sentence, output one digit:
	•	1 if the target word itself is part of a HIPAA identifier.
	•	0 otherwise.

Token-level rule (critical). Label 1 only if this exact word lies inside the minimal span that reconstructs an identifier. Do not label context words that aren’t themselves part of the identifier.

What counts as an identifier (and when a word is “part of” it):
	1.	Names of people (first/last/middle/initials; hyphenated or with initials).
	•	Label the name tokens (e.g., Emma, J-D, Maillard).
	•	Do not label titles alone (Dr., Mr., Ms.) unless fused to the name token.
	2.	Geographic subdivisions smaller than a state: street names, building numbers, cities, ZIPs, neighborhoods, hospitals/clinics as named locations.
	•	Label all tokens that belong to the proper name or address (e.g., Rue, de, la, Paix; 45 in 45 Hauptstrasse; Lausanne, Versoix, Winterthur, Hôpital, de, la, Tour).
	•	Do not label generic words like café, clinic, bank unless part of the named location.
	3.	Dates & times (except year only): month/day names, explicit dates, ordinals, and clock times.
	•	Examples: June, 7th, 05/02, 22.05., 14h00, 8:30, 8h30.
	•	Do not label vague time words like yesterday, tomorrow, morning.
	4.	Phone/fax numbers (any part of the number string, including spaced Swiss formats).
	•	Label numeric chunks that are part of the number: e.g., 079, 321, 56, 78 in 079 321 56 78.
	5.	Email addresses, URLs, IPs: label the entire token (e.g., sara92@uni.edu, http://…, 192.168.0.1).
	6.	IDs and record/account/license numbers: label tokens that are part of the identifier (e.g., ID, 651384; card, number, 400612983 when the phrase card number 400612983 is the identifier).
	•	If number is generic and no actual identifier follows, label 0.
	7.	Device/vehicle IDs, biometric identifiers, photos: label words that directly denote the identifier (e.g., fingerprint, voiceprint, selfie when it is the identifying artifact).

Everything else is 0. Pronouns, common nouns (friend, cousin, clinic), verbs, and numbers that are not part of dates/times/addresses/IDs are 0 (e.g., line in Line 25, 25 there is 0).

Output format. Return only 1 or 0.
