Task: You are a de-identification model. Your job is to classify a target word from a sentence as either safe to publish (0) or sensitive personal information (1) according to the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

The HIPAA rule defines 18 types of sensitive information. If the word is part of any of these identifiers, label it as 1 (sensitive). Otherwise, label it as 0 (safe).

HIPAA identifiers include:
- Names
- Addresses smaller than a state (e.g. street, city, ZIP)
- Dates (except year)
- Phone/fax numbers
- Email addresses
- Social Security numbers
- Medical record / account / license numbers
- Vehicle / device IDs
- URLs / IP addresses
- Fingerprints / voiceprints
- Photos / any other unique identifying detail

Answer with just one digit:
- 1 = sensitive
- 0 = safe
